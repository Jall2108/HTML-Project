	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Panda Relief is a Irish-based international relief and conservation charity established in 2017.</p>
		<p>The goal of Panda Relief is to prevent the destruction of panda forests and to reintroduce them across eastern Asia once their numbers have grown.</p>
		<p>To learn more, we encourage you to visit our <a href="aboutus.html">About Us</a> page.</p>
		<br>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Why pandas?</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Pandas are very important to the ecosystem as they help to keep mountain forests healthy by spreading seeds in their droppings.</p>
		<p>Pandas also suffer from a loss of habitat due to mass deforestation across eastern Asia. Climate change is also negatively affecting their bamboo supplies.</p>
		<br>

	<h2>What's new?</h2>
	<div>
		<h4>November 2020</h3><p>Panda populations have seen an unprecedented rise of 1,400 births this year in captivity alone.</p>
		<h4>July 2020</h3><p> Protesters from Panda Relief along the Chiang River have prevented further deforestation in wild panda regions in order to prevent further wildlife losses.
		<h4>March 2020</h3><p> The International Panda Festival in Beijing has been postponed indefinitely following the outbreak of Covid-19. Stay tuned for more information.
		<p>For more, see our <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>

	<h2>How can you help?</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Panda Relief is always looking for donations to help save the panda species.</p>
		<p>Organised coordinated protests, safeguarding pandas from poachers, and giving care to pandas in both captivity and the wild are our top priorities.</p>
		<p>However, these activities are expensive, and we can't do it alone. Not without your help.</p>
		<p>If you are interested in volunteering, please contact us with the details from <a href="contactus.html">here.</a></p>
		<p>Donations as small as even â‚¬1 make the difference between a living species and a dying one.</p>
