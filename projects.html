	<p><b>Securing a Future for Pandas</b></p>
	<p>Pandas are a vital part of the ecosystem. To help them, we:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Help fight against deforestation and the destruction of their habitat.</li>
		<li>Provide pandas with more nature reserves in their native countries i.e China.</li>
		<li>Sponsor local villages to take care of the environment.</li>
		<li>Fund campaigns for the governments to create stricter poaching laws.</li>
		<li>Encourage panda reproduction.</li>
		<li>Subsidise bamboo farming.</li>
		<li>Spread word about pandas and their predicaments</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Habitat and History</b></p>
	<p> Without a safe habitat, pandas can only survive in captivity. To protect the giant panda's habitat, the Chinese government has set aside 13 panda nature reserves.
	In these areas, farming fields have been left to grow back as forest. Trees and bamboo have grown well, and the original habitat is recovering.
	Farming practices around the forests have been reduced or separated from the reserves.
	According to government research in 2015, the habitat for giant pandas has grown by about 2,720 km<sup>2</sup>, compared to in 2003.
	At 25,770 km<sup>2</sup>, panda habitats are now almost twice the size of Serengeti National Park.
	In the reserve areas, conservation staff live and work to rescue sick or starving pandas, and to stop poachers from hunting giant pandas. 
	</p>
	<p><b> Captive Breeding - Research, Education, and Returning to Wild</b></p>
	<p>In 1980s, much of the bamboo on the Qionglai Mountains (the giant panda's main habitat area) died. Thus many giant pandas were starving, and were rescued to Chengdu Zoo.
	In 1987, to separate the research work, the Chengdu Panda Centre was established for giant panda research. The original six giant pandas have bred more than 150 pandas since!
	Unlike ordinary zoos or attractions, panda research centres focus on research and breeding. 
	There are several panda centres around Chengdu to breed pandas, educate people about protecting pandas, and to do research to help save this lovely species.
	Some research centres, like Dujiangyan Panda Valley, prepare the captive-bred pandas to be introduced into the wild.
	</p>
	<p><b> FUN FACT </b></p>
	<p><b> Laws and Stiff Penalties - Over 10 Years in Jail for Hunting or Smuggling Giant Pandas</b>
	The giant panda is known as the 'national treasure' of China. It's one of the "first class protected species" according to China's Wild Animal Protection Law.
	In the past, there was a lot of giant panda hunting and smuggling of their pelts and body parts, so China's government established laws and severe penalties to protect giant pandas from hunting and smuggling.
